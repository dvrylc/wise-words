Brilliant words by brilliant minds

- "I do not enlighten those who are not eager to learn, nor arouse those who are not anxious to give an explanation themselves. If I have presented one corner of the square and they cannot come back to me with the other three, I should not go over the points again." - **Confucius**
- "The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he alone is responsible. Universes of virtually unlimited complexity can be created in the form of computer programs." - **Joseph Weizenbaum, Computer Power and Human Reason**
- "The art of programming is the skill of controlling complexity. The great program is subdued - made simple in its complexity." - **Eloquent JavaScript, [Introduction](http://eloquentjavascript.net/00_intro.html)**
- "As you learn there will always be new challenges and new territory to explore. Programmers who refuse to keep exploring will stagnate, forget their joy, and get bored with their craft." - **Eloquent JavaScript, [Introduction](http://eloquentjavascript.net/00_intro.html)**
- "Below the surface of the machine, the program moves. Without effort, it expands and contracts. In great harmony, electrons scatter and regroup. The forms on the monitor are but ripples on the water. The essence stays invisibly below." - **Master Yuan-Ma, The Book of Programming**
